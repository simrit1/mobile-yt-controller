## Control desktop YouTube with your mobile phone as remote
It happened yesterday, that we were watching a really boring movie. My laptop was at a distance and me and my family were sitting relaxed. But when some intolerable scenes came, I had no option but to standup, go to the laptop, and either forward the scene or change the speed. During that time I wished I had a remote control for YouTube and today I made it.

Usage:
```
git clone https://github.com/Raunasur/mobile-yt-controller.git
cd mobile-yt-controller
pip install qrcode[pil]
pip install flask
pip install pyautogui
python mobi-yt-controller.py
``` 
Now scan the qrcode with a smartphone connected to the same network (simply put, with the same router or hotspot). Open the web page on phone and youtube on your pc(make sure youtube is the active window), use the buttons and if you liked it. Drop a star.
